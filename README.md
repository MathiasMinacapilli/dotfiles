# Dot files

This repo is intended to share my dot files (and for me to reuse them between computers)

# Getting started

First of all, install `stow` package, used to copy dot files from "dotfiles" folder to
home directory (creating sym links).

1. Clone this repo under home (should be `$HOME/dotfiles`)
1. Inside this repo run script `install.py`
1. Run inside of VIM to install plugins: `:PlugInstall`
1. Install [oh my zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)

# Extra tools
